# Logic-Gates
These are some logic gates I did with transistors.

Vid of "OR", "AND", and "buffer" gates: https://youtu.be/G-6ALcmn04k

Vid of "NOT", "NAND", and "NOR" gates: https://youtu.be/jfQ-Uz33b00

Both of them are made with NPN transistors. 

The scheme and truth table are in the images above.
